        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>A simple salad is a fresh and light dish made with a variety of crisp vegetables, often tossed together with a flavorful dressing. You can start with a base of leafy greens like lettuce, spinach, or arugula, then add chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and red onions for crunch and color. For extra texture, toss in some nuts, seeds, or cheese. Dress it with olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, and season with salt and pepper. It’s easy to customize based on what ingredients you have, making it a versatile, healthy meal or side dish.</p>
