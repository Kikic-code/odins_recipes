        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>A simple vegetable soup is a hearty and healthy dish made by simmering a variety of vegetables like carrots, potatoes, celery, onions, and tomatoes in a flavorful broth. To make it, sauté onions and garlic in a bit of olive oil, then add chopped vegetables and vegetable broth. Season with salt, pepper, and herbs like thyme or bay leaves. Let it simmer until the vegetables are tender. For extra richness, you can add a splash of cream or a sprinkle of cheese before serving. This soup is versatile, so feel free to mix in any veggies you have on hand</p>
        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for sautéing)

            <li>1 medium onion, chopped

            <li>cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li>

            <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced</li>

            <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>

            <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes (or 2 fresh tomatoes, chopped)</li>

            <li>4 cups vegetable broth (or water)</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or fresh thyme, if available)</li>

            <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>

            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>STEPS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients: Chop all your vegetables (onion, garlic, carrots, potatoes, celery, and tomatoes) and set them aside. If you're using fresh herbs, chop those as well.</li>
            <li>Sauté the base: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the veggies: Add the carrots, potatoes, and celery to the pot. Stir everything together and cook for another 5 minutes, letting the veggies soften a bit.</li>
            <li>Add broth and seasoning: Pour in the vegetable broth, then add the diced tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Simmer: Bring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Let it cook uncovered for 20-25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Optional creamy texture: If you want a creamier soup, add the heavy cream or milk at this point. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Finish and season: Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or herbs if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve: Remove the bay leaves, then ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
            <p>Enjoy your homemade vegetable soup!</p>
