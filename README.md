# Odin Recipe Website

This is my first repository where I tried using the command line (CMD), Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and Git. In this project, I learned the basics of HTML and applied my knowledge to create the **Odin Recipe Website**, a simple site built purely with HTML.

## What I Learned

- How to set up and work with **VS Code** for coding and version control.
- The basics of **HTML** structure, tags, and elements.
- Using **Git** for version control, including basic commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Understanding how to organize and structure files for a web project.

This project helped me gain a solid foundation in web development and version control, and Iâ€™m excited to continue building my skills in future projects!

## Project Details

- **Technologies used**: HTML
- **Tools used**: CMD, Visual Studio Code, Git

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the code for my first HTML-based website!
