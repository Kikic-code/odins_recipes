		<p><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4></p>
		<p><em>A classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy cheese, and baked to golden perfection.”</em></p>
		<p><h5>INGREDIENTS</h5></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lasagna sheets (fresh or dried)

Olive oil (for cooking)

Onion (chopped)

Garlic (minced)

Ground beef or chicken (or mushrooms for vegetarian)

Tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes

			<li>Tomato paste</li>

			<li>Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, thyme)</li>

			<li>Salt and pepper</li>

			<li>Ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese)</li>

			<li>Mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>

			<li>Parmesan cheese (grated)</li>

			<li>Egg (optional, to mix with ricotta for creaminess)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><h3>STEPS</h3></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). If you’re using dried lasagna sheets that need boiling, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil while you make the sauce.</li>
			<li>Heat a splash of olive oil in a pan, sauté chopped onion until soft, then add minced garlic and cook briefly. Add ground meat (or chopped mushrooms for vegetarian) and brown it, breaking it into small pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.</li>

			<li>Pour in crushed tomatoes (and a little tomato paste if you like it richer), stir, lower the heat and let the sauce simmer 15–20 minutes so flavors meld and excess liquid reduces. Taste and adjust seasoning; add a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are very acidic.</li>

			<li>While the sauce simmers, mix the ricotta (or cottage cheese) with a beaten egg, a pinch of salt, and some grated Parmesan; stir in chopped fresh parsley or basil if you have it. Shred the mozzarella and grate extra Parmesan for topping.</li>

			<li>If using regular dried sheets that require boiling, cook them according to package directions until just al dente, drain, and lay flat on a clean towel to avoid sticking. If using no-boil sheets, skip this step and follow package notes.</li>

			<li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish to stop the noodles from sticking. Lay down the first layer of lasagna sheets so they slightly overlap, then spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the sheets, spoon on more sauce, and sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella and a little Parmesan.</li>

			<li>Repeat layers (noodles → ricotta → sauce → mozzarella) until the dish is nearly full, finishing with a generous top layer of sauce and a thick sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan so the top browns nicely.</li>

			<li>Cover the dish tightly with foil (spray or rub a little oil on the foil underside so cheese doesn’t stick) and bake for about 25–30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake another 10–15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>

			<li>Take the lasagna out and let it rest 10–15 minutes before slicing; this helps it set so the pieces hold together cleanly.

			<li>Serve with a simple salad and extra grated Parmesan. Leftovers keep well in the fridge for 3–4 days and taste even better the next day.
